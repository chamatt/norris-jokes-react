#norris-jokes-react

A simple project that i'm using to learn react.
It basically displays Chuck Norris Jokes from the [Chuck Norris API](https://api.chucknorris.io/).

This project is based on fang0rnz's [norris](https://github.com/fang0rnz/norris), but it's a much simpler version, without all the added complexities of redux. I tried to acomplish this without looking at he's code, just based what i could see on his [deployed app](https://fang0rnz.github.io/norris)
